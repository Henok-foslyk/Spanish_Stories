# Spanish_Stories

My plan for this project involves:
- Adding a Material UI frontent to let users add stories or generate using GPT

- Firebase Database to store all the stories made.

- Display all available stories.

- GTTS integration to read stories

- possibly include a translation system to make spanish stories from english
